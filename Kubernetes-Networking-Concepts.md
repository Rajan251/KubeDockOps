# Kubernetes Networking Explained Like You're 5 üç™

Imagine Kubernetes is a big toy city where:

- **Pods** = Houses (with toy people inside).
- **Nodes** = Streets (where houses are built).
- **Services** = Mailboxes (to send letters to houses).
- **Ingress** = Post Office (routes letters to the right mailbox).

---

## Let‚Äôs break it down!

### 1. Every Pod (House) Gets Its Own Address
Each Pod (house) has a unique IP (like a street address).

‚ùó Problem: If a Pod crashes, a new one gets a new IP (like moving houses).

‚úÖ **Solution:** Use a **Service** (mailbox)!

---

### 2. Services (Mailboxes) Make Life Easier
A **Service** is like a **mailbox**:

- It has a **fixed name and IP** (e.g., `my-app-service`).
- Even if Pods (houses) change, the mailbox stays the same.

#### Types of Services (Mailboxes)

| Type         | Real-Life Example                                    | Command                                                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ClusterIP`  | A mailbox inside the city (only locals can use it). | `kubectl expose deploy/my-app --port=80`                  |
| `NodePort`   | A mailbox with a big sign (accessible from outside).| `kubectl expose deploy/my-app --type=NodePort --port=80`  |
| `LoadBalancer` | A fancy mailbox with a guard (cloud providers like AWS/GCP add it). | `kubectl expose deploy/my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80` |

---

### 3. Ingress (Post Office) Routes Traffic

üì¶ **Problem:** Too many mailboxes! How do we send letters to the right one?

üì¨ **Solution:** Use **Ingress** ‚Äì it's like the **Post Office**!  
It reads the address and delivers traffic to the correct service (mailbox).

---

#### üçï Example: Pizza Delivery

You want to order pizza at **pizza.com**.

The Ingress routes your requests like this:

- `pizza.com/order` ‚Üí `pizza-service`
- `pizza.com/menu` ‚Üí `menu-service`

---

#### üìù YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pizza-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: pizza.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /order
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: pizza-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /menu
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: menu-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### 4. Network Policies (Traffic Rules)

üö® **Problem:** Bad guys are sending spam letters to our houses (Pods)!

üõ°Ô∏è **Solution:** Use **Network Policies** ‚Äî like hiring a **security guard**  
to control who can talk to whom in the toy city.

---

#### üîí Example:

Only **frontend Pods** are allowed to talk to **backend Pods**.  
Everyone else is blocked.

---

#### üìù YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

### 5. DNS (Phone Book for Services)

üìû **Problem:** It's hard to remember the exact IP address of each mailbox (Service)!

üìö **Solution:** Kubernetes gives every Service a **name**, just like a **phone book entry**.

---

#### üîç Example:

Instead of IPs, you use names like:

- `pizza-service.default.svc.cluster.local` ‚Üí üçï The pizza mailbox  
- `db-service.default.svc.cluster.local` ‚Üí üóÑÔ∏è The database mailbox  

---

üß† **How it works:**  
Kubernetes runs a built-in DNS service called **CoreDNS** that keeps track of all Service names.

So whenever a Pod wants to talk to another Service, it can simply **call the name**,  
and CoreDNS will connect it to the right address ‚Äî even if that address changes!

üìñ Like calling "Pizza Store" instead of remembering the exact number!


### 6. CNI (The Road Builders) üõ£Ô∏è

üöß **Problem:**  
How can Pods (houses) on different streets (nodes) talk to each other?

üõ†Ô∏è **Solution:**  
**CNI plugins** like **Calico**, **Flannel**, and **Weave** are like **road construction crews** ‚Äî  
they **build and maintain the roads** between all the houses (Pods) across all the streets (nodes).

---

#### üß± Real-Life Analogy:

- Without roads: Houses on different streets can't deliver mail or visit each other.
- With CNI: Every house is connected via a road, so Pods on one node can talk to Pods on another.

---

# Kubernetes Networking Commands Cheat Sheet
All essential commands with explanations and arguments.

## 1. Basic Networking Inspection

### List all Pods with IPs
```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
-o wide: Shows Node and IP details.

Use case: Check which Pod runs where and its IP.

## Describe a Pod (See Networking Details)
```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Shows:
- IP address
- Node it‚Äôs running on
- Events (e.g., failed scheduling due to network issues)

## 2. Service Management

### Create a ClusterIP Service
```sh
kubectl expose deployment/my-app --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=my-service
```
--port: Service port (e.g., 80).

--target-port: Pod port (e.g., 8080).

--name: Service name.

### Create a NodePort Service
```sh
kubectl expose deployment/my-app --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=8080
```
--type=NodePort: Exposes on a static port (30000-32767).

### Check NodePort

```
kubectl get svc my-app
```
‚Üí Output: 80:32456/TCP means port 32456 is open on every Node.

### Create a LoadBalancer (Cloud Providers Only)
```sh
kubectl expose deployment/my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
```
Cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure) assign an external IP.

### Check with
```sh
kubectl get svc
```
‚Üí EXTERNAL-IP appears after provisioning.

### Delete a Service

```sh
kubectl delete svc my-service
```

## 3. Ingress Commands

### Apply an Ingress Rule
```sh
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
### List All Ingresses
```sh
kubectl get ingress
```
Shows:

- HOST (myapp.com)
- ADDRESS (IP of the Ingress Controller)

### Delete an Ingress

```sh
kubectl delete ingress my-ingress
```
## 4. Network Policies

### Apply a NetworkPolicy
```sh
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```

### Example network-policy.yaml:

```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```
### List Network Policies
```
kubectl get networkpolicies
```

### Delete a NetworkPolicy
```
kubectl delete networkpolicy allow-frontend-to-backend
```


## 5. DNS & Service Discovery

### Check DNS Resolution Inside a Pod
```sh
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup my-service
```
### Example:
```sh
kubectl exec -it frontend-pod -- nslookup backend-service
```
‚Üí Returns the ClusterIP of backend-service.

### Check CoreDNS Logs
```sh
kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns-pod-name>
```
### Find CoreDNS Pod:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep coredns
```

## 6. Debugging Networking Issues

### Check Service Endpoints
```sh
kubectl get endpoints my-service
```
Shows which Pod IPs are behind a Service.

### Test Connectivity Between Pods
```sh
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- curl http://<another-pod-ip>
```

### Example
```sh
kubectl exec -it frontend-pod -- curl http://10.244.1.3
```

### Port-Forward to Debug Locally
```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80
```
Now access localhost:8080 to test the Service.

### Check kube-proxy Logs
```sh
kubectl logs -n kube-system <kube-proxy-pod-name>
```

## 7. Advanced Networking (CNI, eBPF, Service Mesh)

### Check CNI Plugin (e.g., Calico, Cilium)
```sh
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -E 'calico|cilium'
```
### Install Istio (Service Mesh)
```sh
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```
### Check Istio Ingress Gateway IP
```sh
kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway
```
